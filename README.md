# pdf-d

pdf-d provides an immediate graphical context API for drawing vectorial content inside a multi-page PDF, HTML or SVG.
It is intended to provide a barebones API, in order to build text-aware APIs on top of it. 

Its API is similar to the HTML5 Canvas API.

The ultimate goal would be to generate technical documentation or user manuals with it.

## Goals

- Reproducibility: font embedding implemented for PDF
- Common denominator
